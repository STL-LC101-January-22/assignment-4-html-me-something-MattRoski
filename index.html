         <div id = "tetons">
            <h2>The mountains themselves</h2>
            <p>Living in the midwest my whole life, this was the first time I saw a proper mountain range.</p>

         </div>

         <div id = "mountainView">
            <h2>The view from the mountain</h2>
            <p>I could not believe how far I could see...</p>

         </div>

         <div id = "boat">
            <h2>Boat ride</h2>
            <p>We took a boat over to a secluded and hardly touched area in the park. </p>
            <picture> <img src="Pictures/boat.jpg" style="width:1700px; height:850px;"></picture>

         <div id = "waterfalls">
            <h2>Waterfalls!</h2>
            <p>We followed the path and it led us to a waterfall!</p>
            <picture> <img src="Pictures/waterFall.jpg" style="width:500px; height:850px;"></picture>
            <p>This waterfall was found off a small path on the side of the road.</p>

         </div>

         <div id = "buffalo">
            <h2>Buffalo</h2>
            <p>We met and befriended a Buffalo. He followed us for a few minutes. Kind of made me nervous to be honest. </p>
            <picture> <img src="Pictures/buffalo.jpg" style="width:500px; height:850px;"></picture>
         </div>

         <div id = "bear">
            <h2>BEARS!</h2>
            <p>That chunk of fur is a real grizzly bear. Everyone got out of their cars to admire this beast. You might think that's not very smart, and admittedly, it really isn't... But atleast I was smart enough to stand behind the person in the red jacket. </p>
            <p>To make matters more exciting, my uncle who was driving our van, lost the keys while we were outside! Top five scares for me easy.</p>

         </div>

         <div id = "canyon">
            <h2>Canyon</h2>
            <p>The final day was to see the Grand Canyon of Yellow Stone. This is probably the best picture I've taken in my life. </p>
